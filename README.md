# Mind-Knight


Mind Knight is a companion app to [Mindnight](mindnightgame.com)

It automatically tracks props, votes, passes, vote timing and more in a friendly/scalable UI. It can even connect via any device on the same network through its browser (a phone friendly layout is on the way).

It's in early development and a few key features are still lacking.

This is a passion project of mine since I love Mindnight so much. I am in no way affiliated to the developers.

*If people like this, I will port it to Mac/Linux and also continue developing a bunch more planned features*

# Download
https://github.com/Nik-Novak/Mind-Knight/archive/master.zip

# How to get started
* Download this folder and place it wherever you like
* Run the RUN.bat file in the main/root directory. A console window should show up with a welcoming message if done correctly
* Now you have a choice, view the app on the same PC or on a different device.
  * Same: open a browser and visit localhost:8080
  * Different: Open a browser on any machine on your network and visit your local IP (shown in the welcome message)
* You may go to localhost:8080, or your local IP 192.168.*.* on as many browsers/devices as you want

# Limitations
* Currently only works on windows, it's pretty easy to port to Unix so if enough people want it I will. Check discord.
* Have not tested a 7 man game
* No testing has been done on any other game modes than quick play, mainframe and blind hackers should work...
* The project may have bugs/kinks to iron out since it has just been released
* Known bug: you may have to restart the server (.bat file) after a game returns to lobby.

Have fun!
