# Mind-Knight


Mind Knight is a companion app to [Mindnight](mindnightgame.com)

It automatically tracks props, votes, passes, vote timing and more in a friendly/scalable UI. It can even allow you to replay old games.

This is a passion project of mine since I love Mindnight so much. I am in no way affiliated to the developers.
