# Mind-Knight


Mind Knight is a companion app to [Mindnight](mindnightgame.com)

It automatically tracks props, votes, passes, vote timing and more in a friendly/scalable UI. It can even connect via any device on the same network through its browser (a phone friendly layout is on the way).

It's in early development and a dew key features are still lacking.

# How to use
* Download this folder and place it wherever you like
* Run the RUN.bat file in the main/root directory. A console window should show up with a welcoming message if done correctly
* Now you have a choice, view the app on teh same PC or on a different device.
  * Same: open a browser and visit localhost:8080
  * Different: Open a browser on any machine on your network and visit your local IP in the welcome message

Have fun!
